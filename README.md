- So that my codebase is accesible and easy for all who access it, to read.
- When anyone gains access to my codebase, everyone will have a clear understanding of what is going on in the website.
- Semantic HTML is a very important aspect of creating code so that all of my codebase is accesible and easy to read.

## Installation
